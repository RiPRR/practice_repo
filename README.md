## __Why it is interesting:__ 
I found this article interesting because it showed how easily even big companies like Starbucks can leave themselves vulnerable to attack and exploitation from one simple mistake. Every time I have seen an API key it is always stressed that they should be kept totally secret. Not only was this not kept very secret, but it was left in a public Github repo, which is interesting as it ties in with this very assignment. The other part of the article I found interesting was that companies offer bounties for people to test and discover vulnerabilities in their systems. I had not thought about it before, but that kind of offer makes sense, as even the most extensive testing can leave edge case scenarios undiscovered.
